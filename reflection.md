Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance makes understanding the programming a bit easier since I know that all the classes share the same or similiar attributes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried working on the assignment without reading the README instructions clearly. After reading I used the link to see what methods of the ArrayList and the hashtable I can use. As for advice there is no shame in looking up syntax or a certain method for code since we can't memorize everything.
